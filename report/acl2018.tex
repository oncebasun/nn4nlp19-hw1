\maketitle 
\begin{abstract}
    In this assignment, we implement multi-class text classifiers from scratch. 
    Besides the most basic CNN model, various deep neural architectures are 
    tried, as well as several machine learning strategies for better 
    performance. With acceptable time and memory spending, the best model 
    achieves 86.6\% accuracy on the given validation set. We also conduct a 
    series of experiments to analyze our models.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
    For this assignment, we are given simply pre-processed multi-class text
    classification task data. Each instance in the data is a sentence along with
    a single label that indicates the topic of sentence.

    \begin{table}[htbp]
        \centering
        \small
        %\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
        \begin{tabular}{cp{4.3cm}}
            \toprule
                {\bf Label} & {\bf Sentence} \\
            \midrule
                Music       & The song was written by Madonna and produced by Benitez . \\
            \midrule
                Video games & The developers of the game added round metal shoulders on Samus \' Varia Suit to differentiate it from her Power Suit , since both looked similar on the Game Boy \'s limited greyscale display . \\
            \midrule
                Sports and recreation & The series went to seven games . \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        %}
        \caption{\label{tab:data-example} Some data examples.}
    \end{table}

    In the submission of this assignment, the predicted labels for the
    validation set and the test set are listed in \texttt{predict_val.txt} and 
    \texttt{predict_test.txt} respectively.
